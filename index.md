## who am i?
My name is **Kaan Giray Buzluk (kaangiray26)** and I'm an open-source software developer. That means I work on software projects that are free to use, modify, and distribute. Why? Because I believe knowledge should be free and open to everyone. I'm also studying computer science at the RWTH Aachen University in Germany.

## what else?
I love analog photography, and I have a collection of nice pictures I've taken. You can check them out in the [gallery üñºÔ∏è](/gallery).

Since July 2023, a little script has been running on a server, recording the songs played on Radyo Eksen. You can find them as playlists in my [Spotify profile üé∏](https://open.spotify.com/user/31v5bbakuh7445bhsw7cqknesad4/playlists). They are updated daily and contain some amazing songs that you may not have heard before.

There is also a page where I share [some of my poems üìù](https://kaangiray26.github.io/works/). Feel free to check them out.
