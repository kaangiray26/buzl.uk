## about me
<section markdown=1>
My name is <abbr title="kaangiray26">Kaan Giray Buzluk</abbr> and I'm an open-source software developer. That means I work on software projects that are free to use, modify, and distribute. Why? Because I believe knowledge should be free and open to everyone. I'm also studying computer science at the RWTH Aachen University in Germany.

## other stuff
<section markdown=1>
I love analog photography, and I have a collection of nice pictures I've taken. You can check them out in the [gallery](/gallery).

Since July 2023, a little script has been running on a server, recording the songs played on Radyo Eksen. You can find them as playlists in my other [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/31qj2r3xdqqyvtoprsqa5sksrkva). They are updated daily and contain some amazing songs that you may not have heard before.

There is also a page where I share [some of my poems](https://kaangiray26.github.io/works/). Feel free to check them out.
