However, I can tell I have a taste for it. Here are some of my favorite progressive rock albums that you should listen to.</p><h2 id="scintilla-nosound" tabindex="-1">Scintilla - Nosound <a class="header-anchor" href="#scintilla-nosound" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Scintilla - Nosound&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2734879f4fcb1371a4362ea819a" alt="Scintilla - Nosound"></p><p><a href="https://kscopemusic.com/artists/nosound/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nosound</a> is an Italian band that I&#39;ve found out through Kscope. The band started as a solo project of Giancarlo Erra in 2002. You&#39;ll find a lot of melancholic and ambient sounds in their music. If you like listening to musical poems, you should definitely give them a try. I&#39;m not sure what it is about them, but I can&#39;t get enough of their vocals. Almost too pure and not artificial at all. Last Lunch from the album is a favorite, but I think all of them are growing on me. Oh, and they also have a pretty cool <a href="https://nosound.band/album/scintilla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">website</a> that has lyrics and everything.</p><h2 id="remedies-soup" tabindex="-1">Remedies - Soup <a class="header-anchor" href="#remedies-soup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Remedies - Soup&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730209c5ec5eeee72c58023df6" alt="Remedies - Soup"></p><p>I have their latest album on Bandcamp, but I am still in love with this one. Norway&#39;s <a href="https://www.soupband.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Soup</a> has a unique and nostalgic sound engraved in these 5 tracks. If I should pick a favorite, it would definitely be <strong>The Boy and the Snow</strong>. The album takes you on a journey with its atmospheric and dreamy sounds, especially in the second track with those keys. Let it shine.</p><h2 id="_1919-eternal-black-label-society" tabindex="-1">1919 Eternal - Black Label Society <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1919-eternal-black-label-society" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1919 Eternal - Black Label Society&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273fea4a41a9afe29f52418d157" alt="1919 Eternal - Black Label Society"></p><p>Alright you got me, this is not a progressive rock album. Perhaps it&#39;s not even a rock album. But I wanted to include it because of the 5th track on the list, <strong>Bridge to Cross</strong>. It&#39;s so beautiful you can&#39;t help but listen to it over and over again, but at the same time, it drowns you in sorrow when you least expect it. That&#39;s ladies and gentlemen, a definition of a masterpiece for me. And Zakk Wylde&#39;s guitar solo is cherry on top. If you know any other songs like this one from BLS, please mention this post via <a href="https://www.buzl.uk/2024/08/22/webmentions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Webmentions</a>. After all, it&#39;s just one more bridge to cross.</p><h2 id="stationary-traveller-camel" tabindex="-1">Stationary Traveller - Camel <a class="header-anchor" href="#stationary-traveller-camel" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stationary Traveller - Camel&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273af5c8f54bb6f9f49ea021bf9" alt="Stationary Traveller - Camel"></p><p>Oh, don&#39;t start me on this one! They were an influence for the music giants like Opeth, Steven Wilson, Marillion, and possibly many many more. The harmony of the guitar and the keyboard in the second track, <strong>Refugee</strong>, is just amazing. One thing I don&#39;t really like about it is how short it is. I wish it was longer. Like their other albums, this one is also a concept album, and it tells the story of a divided Berlin during the Cold War. Just listen to them and thank me later.</p><h2 id="materia-novembre" tabindex="-1">Materia - Novembre <a class="header-anchor" href="#materia-novembre" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Materia - Novembre&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273d2029f3a0ad855dc0192fdc1" alt="Materia - Novembre"></p><p>Novembre is also an Italian band, and I think they are quite unique in their own way. Sometimes, all the metal bands try to be the heaviest, but Novembre knows when to be soft and melancholic. As you can guess from the other albums I&#39;ve put here, there is a sheet of atmospheric melodrama covering their music. Although they were absent for a long time, they came back with <strong>Ursa</strong> in 2016. But Materia is still my favorite, especially the track <strong>Nostalgiaplatz(Acoustic)</strong>. I used to listen to it a lot when I was in my second year of college, dealing with computability and complexity. I always thought they suited each other well for some reason. Oh, how I wish they were more popular. It would be great to see them live.</p><h2 id="divided-we-fall-the-black-noodle-project" tabindex="-1">Divided We Fall - The Black Noodle Project <a class="header-anchor" href="#divided-we-fall-the-black-noodle-project" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Divided We Fall - The Black Noodle Project&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273bc095030658cf8343379a258" alt="Divided We Fall - The Black Noodle Project"></p><p>The thing is, I don&#39;t know anything about them, although I&#39;ve listened to all of their albums, and even bought their latest album from 2022. They are a French band, and again, they have lots of melancholic and atmospheric sounds in their music. Among other ones here, they are the one I&#39;ve been listening to a lot lately. I think I&#39;ve scrobbled their <strong>Time</strong> track more than 20 times in the last 2 weeks. But then, why am I giving you this album? Because all the tracks on the list are in my Liked Songs list in Spotify. I think that qualifies them enough. Well, you&#39;ll laugh at me maybe, but I&#39;ll not hesitate to says that some of the songs remind me of The Alan Parsons Project. Anyways, I hope you&#39;ll enjoy them as much as I did.</p><h2 id="blackfield-ii-blackfield" tabindex="-1">Blackfield II - Blackfield <a class="header-anchor" href="#blackfield-ii-blackfield" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Blackfield II - Blackfield&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c72f5478afc56c8bddf6c37d" alt="Blackfield II - Blackfield"></p><p>I bought this album in a CD shop while I was in Barcelona, and yes I still collect CDs. What can I say, this is Steven Wilson&#39;s (another...) side project, in collaboration with Israeli musician Aviv Geffen this time. I don&#39;t like Aviv&#39;s vocals that much, but I think it goes well with Steven&#39;s music. My favorites from this album are <strong>Miss U</strong> and <strong>Some Day</strong>. Oh, <strong>This Killer</strong> is also a very good one. I should stop myself before I list all the tracks. Listen to it if you want to start with Blackield, and then follow up with the <strong>Blackfield</strong>. They are both the best.</p><hr><p>Wow, finally. We made it to the end. If you like these albums, send me some recommendations yourself. I&#39;m always looking for new music to listen to. And if you want to listen to these albums, you can find them on Spotify. Enjoy!</p>',25))])}const y=o(h,[["render",d]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
