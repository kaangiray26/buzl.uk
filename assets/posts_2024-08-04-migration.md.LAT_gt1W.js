I need to change my website, add some silly features, and remove some necessary ones. Until now, I was using Vue.js and GitHub Pages to build and host my website. But it was too exhausting to maintain the website and write new posts because I needed to build the website myself every time I make a change in the code. Besides, I had to deal with HTML and this prevented me from writing new posts frequently. So, I decided to migrate my website to Jekyll as, I can&#39;t stress this enough, I <strong>LOVE üòç</strong> writing in Markdown. If god wanted to send some sacred text to the earth in the 21st century, he would definitely choose Markdown. Anyway, let&#39;s see how it went.</p><h2 id="transferring-stuff" tabindex="-1">Transferring Stuff <a class="header-anchor" href="#transferring-stuff" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Transferring Stuff&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Actually, there was nothing particular to do. Only things I had were some javascript script in my gallery page to toggle dithering of the images and routing of the pages. I copied the static assets and did some tinkering with <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Liquid</a> and javascript to make the same functions work in Jekyll.</p><p>Images were also no problem because I was already using a GitHub repository to store them (plz don&#39;t tell anyone). Jekyll also offers pagination through a plugin called <code>jekyll-paginate</code> which I used to paginate my posts.</p><h2 id="hosting" tabindex="-1">Hosting <a class="header-anchor" href="#hosting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hosting&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Again, GitHub Pages comes to the rescue. However, this time I set up a GitHub Action workflow to build the website and publish it each time I push a commit to the repository. This way, I can just write some new stuff from my phone and push it to the repository just to forget about it.</p><p>Oh, I almost forgot how I ripped off the styling from Bear Blog (I&#39;m sorry but I love the simplicity of it). I just copied the CSS and added some extra classes to suit my needs. Please check out <a href="https://bearblog.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bear Blog</a> and support them. <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Herman</a> is doing a great job.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s it. Don&#39;t wonder too much how it looks like because you are already looking at it. Thanks for checking out my website. If you have anything to say or ask, please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me. Have a great day!</p>',9))])}const b=o(h,[["render",g]]);export{y as __pageData,b as default};
