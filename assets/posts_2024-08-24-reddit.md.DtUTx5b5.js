According to them, the pricing they&#39;ve planned was <strong>&quot;$12,000 per 50 million API requests&quot;</strong>, which meant a death sentence for all the non-commercial apps and bots that were used by millions of users. If you think that&#39;s not a big deal, keep reading...</p><p>You must have heard of the popular Reddit client <a href="https://apolloapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Apollo</a>, developed by <a href="https://christianselig.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Christian Selig</a>, who has also other notable apps like <a href="https://junoapp.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Juno</a>, a YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro. If memory serves right, it was also on the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39225004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hacker News</a>. Christian shared a <a href="https://redd.it/13ws4w3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">post</a> on Reddit stating that <strong>&quot;Apollo would have to pay Reddit $20 million per year to keep running as-is&quot;</strong>. Cricket sounds... I know.</p><h2 id="geddit" tabindex="-1">Geddit <a class="header-anchor" href="#geddit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Geddit&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>I was a Reddit user for a long time and I had lots of bots running on Reddit, just for fun. Upon hearing the news, being an ambitious and naive developer in my third year at university, I decided to inspect the Reddit API to see what I could do. Then I&#39;ve discovered that you could get the whole page in JSON format by adding <code>.json</code> to the end of the URL. That was my big aha moment.</p><p>In a couple days I&#39;ve put together a simple wrapper for the Reddit API as a small Javascript library and named it Geddit, which I thought was a funny name. I&#39;ve shared it on <a href="https://github.com/kaangiray26/geddit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> and I still think it&#39;s working today. With this library, you could view Reddit as a read-only user, with all the features you&#39;d expect from a Reddit client with anonymous browsing. The thing is, you didn&#39;t need to authenticate to use it, which was a way to develop further apps without needing to pay Reddit.</p><p>And then, I came across <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">capacitor</a> and <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ionic framework</a>, which were libraries that allowed you to develop native mobile apps in HTML, CSS and Javascript. It was like <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Electron</a> but for mobile. And things started to get interesting.</p><h2 id="the-app" tabindex="-1">The app <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-app" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The app&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/kaangiray26/geddit-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="'+l+'" alt="Geddit"></a></p><p>This little fella came around the following month as an Android app. It was just a simple JSON parser actually, but it worked well as a Reddit client. People started using it, and wrote to me about it. And it also got me going to see how it was mentioned on the internet.</p><ul><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36690895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hacker News</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/geddit-free-reddit-app-for-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android Police</a></li><li><a href="https://redd.it/14xhc8g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0S6D5TbimA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">YouTube</a></li></ul><p>I know it&#39;s not a big number but there are over 25k downloads solely from the GitHub Releases page to this day, without counting the F-Droid downloads (can&#39;t see the stats).</p><h2 id="end-of-the-road" tabindex="-1">End of the road <a class="header-anchor" href="#end-of-the-road" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;End of the road&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>I&#39;ve released several versions and added some styling based on the Material Design guidelines. Then I&#39;ve published it on the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">F-Droid</a> store, which was something I&#39;ve never done before. It was a great experience to see your app on a store, even if it was a small one.</p><p>And then, I&#39;ve received an e-mail from Reddit. To be honest, I was expecting it.</p><p><img src="https://kaangiray26.github.io/images/reddit-email-1.png" alt="Reddit email 1"></p><p>There were some misunderstandings in the email. This wasn&#39;t a commercial product, nor I was doing some kind of explotiation to use the same API without restrictions. This was just the way how the Reddit website worked if you didn&#39;t have an account. I&#39;ve replied to the email in the most respectful way I could.</p><p><img src="https://kaangiray26.github.io/images/reddit-email-2.png" alt="Reddit email 2"></p><p>I&#39;ve decided to pause the development of the app until I received a response from Reddit, which I never did. So, you might as well say that this project is dead, although it&#39;s still working today. Thanks for the fun, Geddit.</p><hr><blockquote><p>God, I miss the old Reddit. I should start my own text-only social media platform based on Markdown. Maybe I&#39;ll call it &quot;Markit&quot;, and demand $30k per year for the API. Maybe I should just &quot;forgetaboutit&quot;...</p></blockquote>',21))])}const y=o(h,[["render",m]]);export{b as __pageData,y as default};
