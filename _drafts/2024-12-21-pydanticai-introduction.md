## Introduction to PydanticAI
PydanticAI is a Python agent framework designed to simplify the development of production-grade applications using Generative AI. Inspired by FastAPI's innovative and ergonomic design, PydanticAI aims to deliver the same seamless experience when working with LLMs. Built by the team behind Pydantic, this framework ensures you can easily harness the power of various LLM models without losing the Python-centric design that developers are used to.

## Why Use PydanticAI?
PydanticAI offers several key benefits:
- **Built by the Pydantic Team**: Leverage the strong validation layer of popular SDKs like OpenAI and Anthropic.
- **Model-agnostic**: Supports multiple models including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more, ensuring flexibility.
- **Pydantic Logfire Integration**: Monitor performance and behaviour real-time with intuitive debugging tools.
- **Type-safe**: Enjoy enhanced type checking and integration with tools like mypy and pyright.
- **Dependency Injection System**: Facilitates cleaner design patterns for application development.
- **Streamed Responses**: Provides a method for continuously streaming LLM outputs with immediate validation.

## Hello World Example
To illustrate how easy it is to start using PydanticAI, here’s the classic Hello World example:
```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    system_prompt='Be concise, reply with one sentence.'
)

result = agent.run_sync('Where does "hello world" come from?')
print(result.data)
```
This example shows how to configure an agent to use a specific model and send a prompt to get a concise response. Even more complex interactions can be built as you add tools and dynamic prompts.

## Advanced Example: A Bank Support Agent
Consider a more complex example that showcases the capabilities of PydanticAI in creating a bank support agent.

This agent allows users to interact with the system to get their account balance, block cards, and receive advice. The implementation uses dependency injection to keep the code modular and easy to follow:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from bank_database import DatabaseConn

@dataclass
class SupportDependencies:
    customer_id: int
    db: DatabaseConn

class SupportResult(BaseModel):
    support_advice: str = Field(description='Advice returned to the customer')
    block_card: bool = Field(description='Whether to block the customer’s card')
    risk: int = Field(description='Risk level of query', ge=0, le=10)

support_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=SupportDependencies,
    result_type=SupportResult,
    system_prompt=
    'You are a support agent in our bank, give the customer support and judge the risk level of their query.',
)

@support_agent.tool
async def customer_balance(ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies], include_pending: bool) -> float:
    return await ctx.deps.db.customer_balance(id=ctx.deps.customer_id, include_pending=include_pending)
...
```
This snippet shows how PydanticAI abstracts away complexity while allowing you to create functional, type-safe applications. You can also integrate real-time logging and tracking capabilities through Pydantic Logfire, making it easier to monitor the performance and interactions of your agents.

## Next Steps
To explore PydanticAI further, try out the examples in the documentation. The API Reference provides a deeper dive into the interface and capabilities of PydanticAI. As you build your own agents, embrace the Python control flow and techniques you know while leveraging the powerful capabilities of the latest AI models.

PydanticAI is still in its early beta stages, and user feedback is greatly encouraged. Join the community and contribute to this exciting project!

Stay tuned for more updates as PydanticAI continues to evolve!
