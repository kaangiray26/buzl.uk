## contact
<section markdown=1>
You can reach me via [email](mailto:kaangiray26@protonmail.com). You can also find me on [github](https://github.com/kaangiray26) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaangiray26/).

Or, maybe you have something really important to tell me? Alright, you can use my [PGP public key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/540F917D4C350112D6B180B5F7F01DE9D67AF192) to send me encrypted messages.

I'd love to hear from you, your thoughts, feedback, or anything else. Don't hesitate to just say a simple "hi"!
