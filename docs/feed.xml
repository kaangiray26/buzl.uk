                I‚Äôve built something, and I‚Äôll probably regret it later. You remember Electron? How can you forget, it‚Äôs everywhere, even in your text editor. So, I thought, I can build something similar for Python. Aaaand, here we are. I present you, Positron.

                Have you ever wanted to set random actions to your keyboard keys but realized that you use them all for other purposes, like writing? Well, with this little trick, you can use your earbuds (in an unconventional way) to run custom actions on your computer.

                How it all startedAround June 2023 Reddit announced their new API pricing, I mean it‚Äôs kinda wrong to say ‚Äúnew API pricing‚Äù because until that time it was all free to use the API. According to them, the pricing they‚Äôve planned was ‚Äú$12,000 per 50 million API requests‚Äù, which meant a death sentence for all the non-commercial apps and bots that were used by millions of users. If you think that‚Äôs not a big deal, keep reading‚Ä¶

                I‚Äôm slowly losing my interest in frameworks and tools. It came as a surprise to me but I‚Äôm ‚Äúactively‚Äù picking plain HTML, CSS, and as little JavaScript as possible over Vue.js, Alpine.js or others. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I used a Bootstrap component or even a Bootstrap class. I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôve become an expert in web development, like an artist, who can spit out elements and styles from his mind. Quite the opposite actually. Not being dependent on something leaves you with time to think about what you can do differently. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve found with Jekyll.

                I‚Äôve been using Zed as my main editor for over a month now. The reason I switched from VSCode was that VSCode was too slow when I was working with multiple windows open. Switching back and forth between windows was creating a lag that was unbearable. I saw Zed as a lightweight and crazy fast alternative, and I wanted to give it a try. There were some problems however‚Ä¶

                That time of the year has come again. I need to change my website, add some silly features, and remove some necessary ones. Until now, I was using Vue.js and GitHub Pages to build and host my website. But it was too exhausting to maintain the website and write new posts because I needed to build the website myself every time I make a change in the code. Besides, I had to deal with HTML and this prevented me from writing new posts frequently. So, I decided to migrate my website to Jekyll as, I can‚Äôt stress this enough, I LOVE üòç writing in Markdown. If god wanted to send some sacred text to the earth in the 21st century, he would definitely choose Markdown. Anyway, let‚Äôs see how it went.

                Recently, I‚Äôve become curious about the visitor statistics of my websites. After a quick search, I decided to just build my own analytics solutionto avoid any big brother-like companies (I‚Äôm looking at you big 5). So, here we are, building a simple analytics solution with DuckDB.
