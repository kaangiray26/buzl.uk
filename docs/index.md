## About me

My name is Kaan Giray Buzluk and I’m an open-source software developer. That means I work on software projects that are free to use, modify, and distribute. Why? Because I believe knowledge should be free and open to everyone. I've recently graduated from RWTH Aachen University with a degree in Computer Science.

## Latest Projects

Here are **some** of the projects I’m currently working on:

- [Codex](https://github.com/kaangiray26/codex) - LLM voice assistant for real-time document QA
- [Positron](https://github.com/kaangiray26/positron) - Build desktop apps with Python
- [Mezzo](https://github.com/kaangiray26/mezzo) - A simple, open-source music player
- [Messenger](https://github.com/kaangiray26/messenger) - An open-source end-to-end encrypted P2P Messenger
- [Nocturne](https://github.com/kaangiray26/nocturne) - An open-source client-side PDF editor with pipelines
- [Geddit](https://github.com/kaangiray26/geddit-app) - An open-source Reddit client for Android using the public JSON feeds
- [Forte](https://github.com/kaangiray26/forte) - Self-hosted, music streaming platform

## Other stuff

I love analog photography, and I have a collection of nice pictures I’ve taken. You can check them out in the gallery.

Since July 2023, a little script has been running on a server, recording the songs played on Radyo Eksen. You can find them as playlists in my other [Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/31qj2r3xdqqyvtoprsqa5sksrkva). They are updated daily and contain some amazing songs that you may not have heard before.

There is also a page where I share [some of my poems](https://kaangiray26.github.io/works/). Feel free to check them out.
