I wanted to share this trick for adding simple spinners to your website. It's just a few lines of CSS, and you can also customize which icons to use.

So, we want to add it easily, it should be simple as `<spinner></spinner>` in our HTML. Actually, it is that simple. Here is the CSS for our custom spinner tag:

```css
spinner::after {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    width: 32px;
    height: 32px;
    font-size: 32px;
    aspect-ratio: 1 !important;
    content: "progress_activity";
    font-family: "Material Symbols Outlined";
    animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}

spinner[icon]::after {
    content: attr(icon);
}

spinner[reverse]::after {
    animation-direction: reverse;
}

@keyframes spin {
    0% {
        transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    100% {
        transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
}
```

Just a single CSS class! However, you need to include the Material Symbols Outlined font in your project by adding this line to the top of your CSS file:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@24,400,1,0");
```

Now, let's see how it looks in action:
<spinner></spinner>

You can also customize the spinner icon by adding an `icon` attribute to the spinner tag. For example, `<spinner icon="cameraswitch"></spinner>` will show a camera switch icon spinning:
<spinner icon="cameraswitch"></spinner>

Forget about Material Icons, you can also use emojis as spinner icons. And there is also a `reverse` attribute to make the spinner spin in the opposite direction. For example, `<spinner icon="🤸🏻‍♂️"></spinner>` will show a person cartwheeling:
<spinner icon="🤸🏻‍♂️" reverse></spinner>

That's it! You can now use this simple spinner in your projects. Enjoy!
