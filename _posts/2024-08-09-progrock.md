I'm not going to start with explaining what progressive rock is, because I have no idea. However, I can tell I have a taste for it. Here are some of my favorite progressive rock albums that you should listen to.

## Scintilla - Nosound

    <a href="https://kscopemusic.com/artists/nosound/">Nosound</a> is an Italian band that I've found out through Kscope. Giancarlo Erra started the band as a solo project in 2002. You'll find a lot of melancholic and ambient sounds in their music. If you like listening to musical poems, you should definitely give them a try. I'm not sure what it is about them, but I can't get enough of their vocals. Almost too pure and not artificial at all. Last Lunch from the album is a favorite, but I think all of them are growing on me. Oh, and they also have a pretty cool <a href="https://nosound.band/album/scintilla/">website</a> that have lyrics and everything.
