I really love Vue.js, I really do. But sometimes, I just want to use the good old HTML tags alone with little to no JavaScript. Simplicity is best heard when there is chaos around. So, long story short, I am forcing myself for little projects to use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and its little brother [Quart](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), so that I can take a break from the things I got used to and discover some new patterns. And I've decided to make a [music player](https://github.com/kaangiray26/mezzo) with it.

But as you may already see, there is a problem with the tools I've chosen. Building a music player with Flask is not a problem, but without the routing, the media playback gets interrupted when the user navigates to another page. That's today's problem, at least for me, before coffee and breakfast.
