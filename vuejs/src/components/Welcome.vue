                    My name is Kaan Giray Buzluk. I am a computer science student at RWTH Aachen and I've been coding
                    for over 8 years. </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    During this time I've worked on a lot of projects that I didn't believe I could finish. There was
                    just one path on my mind: Find what you don't know and go all the way towards it. So, I followed the
                    path until I was able to bring those dreams into my world.
